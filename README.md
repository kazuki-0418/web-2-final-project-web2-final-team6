# Web 2 - Final Project

**Goal:** Plan as a team and create a responsive business website using Astro and other libraries.

**Figma Mockup:** [https://www.figma.com/design/0AQxNEvhd7v8FnHJN6yo1y/Ddsgnr---Corporate-Website?node-id=1-53&t=tx1bJRULVV5IPJdJ-1]

## 📖 Instructions

1. Choose one of the mockup templates from Figma that you want to build.
2. Create a GitHub Project inside your repository. Ideally, the leader or PM should be the one to create the project.
3. Decide and create tasks for each member of your team and which section or page they will work on.
4. Create branches depending on the section or page you are working on.
5. After cloning the repository, make sure to do `cd final-project` to change directory and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies needed by Astro.
6. Before the presentation day, make sure your changes have been merged to the *main* branch.

## ⚙️ Features

- Working form
  
  Each template has some sort of form included in the design. Make sure to make this work by using an API such as *EmailJS*. For the dropdown fields, it can be whatever you like as long as clicking submit will send an email.
- Responsive

  The website needs to be responsive. The mobile mockups are also already provided.
- GSAP (optional)

  Make your website more interactive by adding simple or complex animations.

## 👥 Teamwork

- If something fails in your team, it is not one of your team member's failure but WHOLE TEAM.
- If you do not want to lead, follow the lead.
- Decide as a team.
- Be responsive - no longer than half day.
- Let others know if you think you are behind.
- If you stuck on a problem more than 1 hour, It is time to ask for help.
- Once you are finished on a task, mark it as done.

**Good luck! 🎉🎉🎉**
